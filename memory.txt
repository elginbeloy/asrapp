 Okay, so this will be a basic test of it doing the reprocessing. Every six chunks it should reprocess the entire audio clip and you should see the text update and be refined essentially, better than it was before. So let's see if it does it. Oh, there was one right there. Yeah, it looks like it did get slightly better. And you'll see when I press ctrl c and end the session, it will re-refine it again before it ends to have a final transcript that's more accurate. It does the entire audio clip right now, but we could make it only do batch chunks, like a larger batch for the re-refinement, and then do the entire audio clip for the final transcription processing. Because it can be kind of processing intensive, especially if these get really long. After like a couple minutes it starts, I can hear the laptop running. I wonder how it will transcribe that verum sound there. Let's wait for it to reprocess. I'm going to press control C, appear pretty soon. Right now this is using WISPR small. Since you have a stronger computer than me Gavin you should definitely be using like WISPR large or something and it will be better. You can check that out. In the future we should try to be maybe using like cloud computer or something. under control C
